The first king of Wakanda, Black Panther Bashenga, harnessed the mineral and used it to nurture his nation. Thousands of years later, under the ruling of Black Panther <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/tchaka\/4005-62659\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62659\">T\u2018Chaka<\/a>, Wakanda's level of technological and economic achievements continued to excel far beyond those of the modern world.<\/p><p>T'Chaka concealed Wakanda from the rest of world to prevent it from being manipulated by outsiders. His first wife, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/nyami\/29-70733\/\">N'Yami<\/a>, died while in labor with Prince T\u2019Challa. Years later, a Dutch scientist named Ulysses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/klaw\/29-3171\/\">Klaw<\/a> found a way into Wakanda, created a vibranium sound-based weapon, and used it to kill King T\u2019Chaka. Prince T\u2019Challa, only a child at the time, managed to turn the sound weapon on Klaw, destroying his right hand. Klaw fled the country, exposed Wakanda to the outside world, and vowed revenge.<\/p><p>Prince T'Challa would later become king after defeating his uncle, King <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/syan\/4005-59942\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59942\">S'yan<\/a>, in a once-a-year ritual that allowed anyone of Wakandan royalty to become king\/queen by defeating the current ruler in hand-to-hand combat.

Using his superhuman senses of sight, smell, and hearing combined with his enhanced panther-like reflexes, he divided his time as a king and crime fighter. During the characters first debut, Stan Lee scribes the African hero defeating the American superhero team, the Fantastic Four.<\/p><p>Several years later, in 1968, <a href=\"\/roy-thomas\/4040-42067\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas<\/a> scribes the character's first appearance as an <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/avengers\/4060-3806\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avenger<\/a>. In 1972, after the first four issues, the Black Panther becomes the titular character of <a href=\"\/don-mcgregor\/4040-44540\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44540\">Don McGregor<\/a>'s <em>Jungle Action<\/em>. McGregor's \"<a href=\"\/panthers-rage\/4045-55776\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55776\">Panther's Rage<\/a>\" is one of the most critically acclaimed stories of the Black Panther mythos. The co-creator of the Black Panther, Jack Kirby, would later go on to illustrate and scribe the hero's solo series in 1977.<\/p><p>In 1998, <a href=\"\/christopher-priest\/4040-41500\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41500\">Christopher Priest<\/a> began writing the Black Panther's following series. Priest modernized the character by building and expanding upon the Black Panther mythos mapped out by Lee and McGregor. In Priest's retcons of Wakanda, he established Bastet (the ancient Egyptian God) as the panther god that the Wakandans built their religious cult of the Black Panther around. Prior to this retcon, the Wakandan panther god did not have a name\/origin. Priest's interpretation of the Black Panther is widely praised.<\/p><p>In 2005, TV\/movie scribe <a href=\"\/reginald-hudlin\/4040-41772\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41772\">Reginald Hudlin<\/a> began writing the Black Panther. Hudlin's tenure retconned a lot of what was previously established about the character, as he rebooted the heroes adventures. However, major establishments, like T'Challa being a warrior king, all stayed true to the classic tales of the Black Panther. Hudlin's tenure on the Black Panther is the most commercially successful series of the Black Panther franchise.

Afterwards, he and the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/dora-milaje\/4060-55780\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55780\">Dora Milaje<\/a>, along with Monica Lynne, were approached by <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/white-wolf\/4005-11458\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11458\">Hunter the White Wolf<\/a>, who wanted to help T'Challa take back Wakanda. A midst conversing about a potential team up, they were all separated by a surprise attack by the US &amp; Russian secret services.<\/p><p>Elsewhere, after hearing that T\u2019Challa verbally denounced war against the United States, Achebe began destroying Wakanda, with its own technology, to prove to T\u2019Challa that he was in control of the country. Also, hundreds of Ghudazai soldiers invaded Wakanda under the order of Achebe. Back in New York,<a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/monica-lynne\/4005-11002\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11002\"> Monica Lynne<\/a> (T\u2019Challa\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9) was attacked by the Russian mob after T\u2019Challa and Hunter went off to fight the secret service. The Dora Milaje, however, were able to protect her.<\/p><p>Hunter is 12 years older than T\u2019Challa. As a baby, he was the lone survivor of a plane crash that landed outside of Wakanda. He was then raised and declared a Wakandan citizen by King T\u2019Chaka (T\u2019Challa\u2019s father). He became the leader of Wakanda\u2019s secret police, the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/hatut-zeraze\/4060-55816\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55816\">Hatut Zeraze<\/a>. Hunter would do anything he could, no matter how violent, to appease King T\u2019Chaka. Upon becoming king, T\u2019Challa disbanded the Hatu Zeraze and Hunter decided to leave Wakanda, which is why he was in New York. T\u2019Challa accepted Hunter\u2019s offer of assistance and Hunter vowed absolute loyalty to him. However, T'Challa's acceptance was all a ruse. He did not trust Hunter, citing his excessively violent history, as the reason why. T\u2019Challa later knocked him unconscious, regrouped with the others, and flew to Wakanda to face Achebe.<\/p><p>When he finally confronted Achebe at the Wakandan Palace, T'Challa allowed himself to be captured. He knew that Achebe would flee the country in fear, basically exiling himself, making him ruler again. When T\u2019Challa escaped Achebe\u2019s deathtrap, he was confronted by Hunter. The two engage in combat, which ended with T\u2019Challa using a pinched never technique. They then flee the palace, going their separate ways, as Achebe\u2019s explosive devices detonate.<\/p><h3>Marriage: Civil War<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3208116\" data-ratio=\"1.0471204188482\" data-width=\"382\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 382px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3208116\"><img alt=\"The Royal Couple; King T'Challa and Queen Ororo (Storm)\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-width=\"611\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg 382w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Royal Couple; King T'Challa and Queen Ororo (Storm)\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-width=\"611\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Royal Couple; King T'Challa and Queen Ororo (Storm)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After teaming up with the X-Men a few times, T'Challa and <a href=\"..\/..\/storm\/29-1444\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ororo Munroe<\/a> (Storm) began dating.

As a result, the Wakandan-Skrull war began. T'Challa began to defend his nation with cunning tactics and technological marvels. Eventually, the two factions found themselves at a loss of technological weaponry. As a result, the two forces began to use old fashion and more primitive weaponry such as, the sword &amp; shield. T'Challa was able to defeat the \"<a href=\"..\/..\/super-skrulls\/65-57545\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Skrulls<\/a>\" (including a massively large Skrull with the abilities of <a href=\"..\/..\/iron-fist\/29-1492\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Fist<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/wolverine\/29-1440\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/luke-cage\/29-1450\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/bullseye\/29-4647\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bullseye<\/a>), while Shuri and Storm lead an infantry legion against the Skrull.

Elsewhere, Doom infiltrated Wakanda and managed to steal a large amount of processed vibranium.<\/p><p>He ventured to his home nation, Latveria, where he began attacking various cities around the world by using the vibranium to manipulate all vibranium-based objects and structures. Storm, Shuri, the Dora Milaje, and the Fantastic Four were instructed to take out Doom's worldwide network facilities, while T'Challa initiated a plan to save the world. The heroes later traveled to Latveria to confront Doom.<\/p><p>T'Challa engaged in combat with Doom and managed to plant a remote device on him that made processed vibranium inert.The device was so powerful that all vibranium across the world became defunct. Doom's newly acquired vibranium-based armor was rendered useless and he was defeated. T'Challa then returned to Wakanda to store some remaining active vibranium, that was recovered with the help of Storm, the X-Men, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.<\/p><h3>Black Panther: Most Dangerous Man Alive<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211914\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211914\"><img alt=\"Black Panther: Man without Fear\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Panther: Man without Fear\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Panther: Man without Fear<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In order to defeat Doctor Doom, during the events of <a href=\"\/doomwar\/4045-56115\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56115\">Doomwar<\/a>, T'Challa was forced to destroy Wakanda's vibranium reserves by making the substance inert.

The two factions then began to fight one another.<\/p><p>The Phoenix is incidentally divided into five energies by Iron Man, with each part taking a host, all of whom were X-Men. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/cyclops\/4005-1459\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/emma-frost\/4005-1457\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/colossus\/4005-1460\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/magik\/4005-8303\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/namor\/4005-1476\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor<\/a> were bestowed and they began to reform the world to their will. Although some of their actions were generous and peaceful, the Avengers feared that such powerfully immense beings should not go unchecked. During the chaos that followed, T'Challa allied himself with the Avengers and Storm allied herself with the X-men. Many Wakandans were confused as to why their queen would ally herself with the X-Men and quickly declared her a traitor to the Wakandan Kingdom.<\/p><p>T'Challa provided a safe-house for the Avengers in Wakanda. In search of them, Namor attacked and almost sank Wakanda, killing hundreds if not thousands of its citizens. T'Challa was saddened and infuriated at the X-men as he declared them all enemies of his country. Storm later arrived in Wakanda and saw what Namor had done. She then approached T'Challa as he grieved for the lives that Namor had taken. Out of frustration at what had just happened, he scolded her. She attacked him (to his surprise) and the two began to fight. The Wakandans were shocked and confused as to why she would attack him and the High Priest of Wakanda annulled the marriage.<\/p><h3>The Illuminati<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3211804-9388617086-27280.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211804\" data-ratio=\"1.517571884984\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3211804-9388617086-27280.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211804\"><img alt=\"From left to right: Black Bolt, Iron Man, Black Panther, Dr. Strange, and Mr Fantastic.

Iron Man proposed that they form a government of superhumans similar to the United Nations that would meet regularly, in secret, to prevent an event like the Kree-Skrull War from happening again. After some debating, all except T'Challa agreed to form this \"<a href=\"..\/..\/illuminati\/65-40421\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illuminati<\/a>.\" T'Challa declined at the time, because he felt that the group would fail, due to them deciding that they were going to attempt to secretly govern the world.<\/p><p>Sometime later, after the events of <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/avengers-vs-x-men\/4045-56674\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">AvsX<\/a>, T'Challa reconsidered joining the Illuminati after witnessing an event known as an \"Incursion\". An incursion is when two alternate universes collide into each other with alternate Earths as the epicenter. T'Challa encountered <a title=\"Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-TRN265)\" href=\"http:\/\/marvel.wikia.com\/Yabbat_Ummon_Turru_(Earth-TRN265)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Swan<\/a>, a woman from an alternate Earth who had destroyed her own Earth to prevent it from colliding with Earth-616. T'Challa was on an expedition, in the jungles of Wakanda, with some potential candidates for Wakanda's space program, when she attacked them.<\/p><p>After Black Swan ordered her mercenaries to kill several of his candidates, T'Challa killed them and managed to capture her. He then contacted the Illuminati to report what he had just witnessed. Upon joining them, he swore to kill fellow Illuminati member, Namor, for attempting to sink Wakanda during the events of AvsX. The Illuminati and the Black Panther go on to deal with several more incursions, attempting to avoid doing what Black Swan had done, which was to destroy one alternate Earth to prevent it from colliding with another. However, the group finally realized that destroying the alternate Earths was their best option.<\/p><p>As time progressed, the hostilities between Wakanda and Atlantis increased. In an attempt to end the feud, Namor presented a peace offering to T'Challa for him to relay to his sister, Queen Shuri, the current ruler of Wakanda. T'Challa presented the peace offering to Queen Shuri, but she discarded it, citing that Namor's actions during AvsX was an act of terrorism. She then ordered an attack on Atlantis, while T'Challa distracted Namor with a fraudulent acceptance. The <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/hatut-zeraze\/4060-55816\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55816\">Hatut Zeraze<\/a>, Wakanda's secret police, went on to decimate Atlantis.<\/p><p>The war conflict between the two men reached its breaking point during the Illuminati's battle with the <a href=\"\/great-society\/4060-60698\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60698\">Great Society<\/a>. T'Challa was poised to use an antimatter bomb to destroy the Society's world in order to save Earth-616, but refused to do so, as it would mean killing billions of innocent people. Namor then stole the detonator away and destroyed the planet anyway, claiming that he had the guts to do what T'Challa and the others would not. T'Challa savagely attacked Namor, but their confrontation was interrupted by the <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk<\/a>. Namor was expelled from the Illuminati for his actions, and left to form a new iteration of the <a href=\"\/cabal\/4060-56051\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal<\/a>. For failing to destroy the Great Society's world (thus proving he does not have the will to defend Wakanda no matter what), the spirits of T'Chaka and the other past Black Panthers chastise T'Challa and shun him.<\/p><p>Eight months later, the Cabal had utterly decimated Wakanda. With the last survivors evacuated, T'Challa was given his father's ceremonial dagger by Shuri just before she was killed by <a href=\"\/proxima-midnight\/4005-90522\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90522\">Proxima Midnight<\/a>. The fugitive members of the Illuminati later joined forces with the Avengers after Namor begged for help, explaining that the members of the Cabal (particularly <a href=\"\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos<\/a>) had become too difficult to control. During the mission to trap the Cabal on an exploding world, T'Challa stabbed Namor and left him for dead. Unbeknownst to him, both Namor and the Cabal managed to survive.<\/p><h3>Secret Wars<\/h3><p>During the final incursion, Black Panther was one of the heroes that tried to stop Earth-1610 from destroying his Earth. After the vessel transporting the Earth's \"resurrection team\" was destroyed by the Children, Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther was forced to put the \"lifeboat\" in action. As the \"lifeboat\" was deployed, Manifold teleported numerous heroes into it including Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Captain Marvel, Cyclops, and Thor, which allowed them to survive the end of the Multiverse.<\/p><p>Black Panther and the other heroes in the life raft would later be awakened by Doctor Strange eight years after the end of the Multiverse and the creation of <a href=\"\/battleworld\/4020-51065\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51065\">Battleworld<\/a>, a planet cobbled together from the fragments of destroyed realities ruled by Doom.<\/p><p>Black Panther and the other heroes were later transported by Strange to confront the Cabal after a distress call was sent to him by one member of the Thor Corps, and after this Doom himself appeared to quell the fighting. When Doom tried to kill them, Doctor Strange teleported them across Battleworld, but at the cost of his own life. Black Panther ended up in the domain of Egyptia along with Namor.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6012801\" data-ratio=\"0.593\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6012801\"><img alt=\"With the Infinity Gauntlet\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"With the Infinity Gauntlet\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/133942\/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>With the Infinity Gauntlet<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Three weeks later, while Battleworld was in dsarray, T'Challa, with Namor, arrived to Strange's Hidden Isle of Agamotto, using the Key of Agamotto given to them by Strange, they entered, and after identifying themselves as member of the Illuminati to a projection of the deceased Sorcerer Supreme, they were given access to some powerful items Strange had collected over the years, including the Siege Courageous and an Infinity Gauntlet that worked only in Doomstadt. Black Panther and Namor next traveled to the Deadlands for reinforcements, and Black Panther used his title as the King of the Dead to convince the zombies to join the forces opposing Doom. Using the Siege Courageous, the two of them arrived to the battlefield along with the zombies, proclaiming that Doom's reign is over.<\/p><p>Doom tried to convince T'Challa that he would rebuild Wakanda if he would stop fighting, but he refused the offer and struck Doom down.

As the inhabitants of Battleworld were trying to run from their ultimate demise, Black Panther gripped tightly to the Reality Gem and was transported to his reborn native universe in the rebuilt Wakanda, to the time directly before the events of the incursions.<\/p><h3>The Ultimates<\/h3><p>T'Challa was approached by <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/carol-danvers\/4005-21561\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers<\/a> about creating a problem solving team to deal with threats to Earth and the Universe on a cosmic scale. The team was formed consisting of Captain Marvel, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/blue-marvel\/4005-57033\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57033\">Blue Marvel<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/spectrum\/4005-11337\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Spectrum<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ms-america\/4005-78932\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78932\">Ms America<\/a> and Black Panther. The first of their missions involved <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/galactus\/4005-2149\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus<\/a>, T'Challa teleported himself into deep space to meet with Captain Marvel and Blue Marvel and open a dialogue with Galactus. T'Challa conversed with him explaining how he knew about the chamber which Galactus incubated himself in, and that it was still out in space containing unconsumed power. Along with the help of the Ultimates the team managed to get Galactus back into the chamber, which he then emerged out of reborn as Galactus the Lifebringer.<\/p><p>The next problem that the Ultimates sought to solve was the timestream which had been broken due to the abuse of time travel. They came to the conclusion that they cannot see the extent of the damage from within the Omniverse. T'Challa along with the help of Blue marvel developed a vehicle which can allow them to leave all that is known to view the timestream from outside the Omniverse. Travelling through the universe and different dimensions such as the Superflow and the Neutral Zone, they eventually manage to break out and leave the Omniverse. However, the vehicle they were in could not withstand the conditions exposing the Ultimates leaving them vulnerable, only to be saved by Galactus. T'Challa explained to him that they were there due to time being broken, to which Galactus responded sharing with them his own view of the time flow.<\/p><p>T'Challa and the Ultimates also played a role in Civil War II due to their use of the visions of Ulysses a new Inhuman that supposedly predicted the future. The Ultimates acted on these visions trying to stop problems before they happened. Most notably T'Challa was present on the mission to stop the attack by Thanos predicted by Ulysses. They succeeded in capturing Thanos but at the cost of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/war-machine\/4005-1926\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine<\/a> who was killed in the battle. Thanos also subsequently escaped his holding cell but T'Challa and Blue Marvel managed to stop him again using their intellect to create a device to shut down Thanos' brain temporarily.<\/p><p>Eventually the Ultimates were disbanded due to T'Challa's actions in Civil War II where he publicly disagreed with Captain Marvels actions, claiming she had gone too far and an attack on him meant an attack on Wakanda. The American government could not continue with the Ultimates operations due to the political move by T'Challa leading to the disbanding of the Ultimates.<\/p><h3>A Nation Under Our Feet<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250922\" data-ratio=\"0.64819944598338\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250922\"><img alt=\"Providing a glimpse into his true power\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png 361w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Providing a glimpse into his true power\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png 361w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111126675\/5250922-black+panther+1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Providing a glimpse into his true power<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>8 months after the events of Secret Wars, Black Panther returned to his home in Wakanda as the king. After facing threats of cosmic levels, he finally sought to return to a normal life. His wish was not fulfilled when he returned to a revolution against the idea of his monarchy led by <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/zenzi\/4005-127863\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127863\">Zenzi<\/a>. At this time he is also coping with the seeming death of his sister, Shuri. With all of his pent up rage, he finally learned to release and revealed that for his entire life he was holding back. He vowed to demonstrate his true power from that moment forwards.<\/p><p>His rule however, was contested by opposition groups who believed he was not fit to rule and that he did not protect Wakanda from the threats it had faced. Two of the greatest Dora Milaje, the midnight warriors Aneka and Ayo opposed T'Challa and left the Dora Milaje to oppose his rule with the key phrase 'no one man'. They had found their own followers building up a community of people who wanted to leave the kings rule and took over the Jabari-Lands. Another group that opposed T'challa was called 'the people' lead by <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/tetu\/4005-129745\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-129745\">Tetu<\/a> a former student of the Wakandan philosopher <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/changamire\/4005-132088\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-132088\">Changamire<\/a> who's teachings were used as the war drum for the rebels and <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/zenzi\/4005-127863\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127863\">Zenzi<\/a> who were the leaders of the rebels.<\/p><p>Tetu and Zenzi had amassed a fairly large amount of followers and even turned some into living bombs using repulsor technology one of which had detonated in the heart of Wakanda injuring Ramonda T'challa's mother. T'challa even recruited some of his friends from outside Wakanda to help him fight the rebels such as <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/luke-cage\/4005-1450\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage<\/a>, <a href=\"\/storm\/4050-7191\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-7191\">Storm<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/manifold\/4005-62072\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62072\">Manifold<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/misty-knight\/4005-1491\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1491\">Misty Knight<\/a>. He even went to further lengths organising a counterrevolution council of dictators who had experience in dealing with revolution. However, he was betrayed and the evidence of this meeting with highly questionable characters got to the people of Wakanda which hurt the King's standing with the people even though he rejected all suggestions. While all this was going on T'challa was also working on bringing his sister <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/shuri\/4005-58997\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri<\/a> back from the living death she was entrapped in during <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos<\/a>'s invasion of Wakanda. He managed to succeed in doing this using the help of Manifold and returned Shuri back to life, though she now had supernatural powers.<\/p><p>With Shuri's help and the Changamire's speech to the people, support for T'challa and the government was back and he began to devise a way to defeat the rebels once and for all. Tetu and Zenzi amassed their forces for a final assault on the centre of Wakanda the forces held them off for a while with the help of Shuri and Manifold. Eventually the forces did break through to the city, but T'challa had lead Tetu and his forces to him.

Giant Man asks T'Challa to take him back to his lab when he notices that Hank had been bitten by a zombie. He questions Hank about the bite and he attacks him and he falls unconscious. He awakes and realises that his right arm and leg is missing and that Giant Man is keeping him prisoner as a source of food. With the help of Wasp, whose head remained animated, he eventually escapes the lab.<\/p><p>After making a crutch and tucking Wasp's head under his arm he makes his way through the ruins of the city and is confronted by the Acolytes, who mistake him for a zombie. After a failed attack, Black Panther joins forces with them and they aboard Asteroid M. While there he meets Forge and he helps build a cybernetic arm and leg for him. While here he also meets Lisa Hendricks who he later marries and has a son with.<\/p><p>Five years later, the Acolytes land Asteroid M in the middle of New York after a scan detected no movement on the planet. Black Panther, along with his wife and child, step into the world. Wasp comes with them, her hunger being replenished. It is around this time that T'Challa receives a call from a Black Panther from another reality who is having problems with zombified super-heroes on the Skrull home-world.<\/p><p>Forty years later, New York is now renamed Wakanda and T'Challa is now king. However, there is no reliable way to restore the population that once lived in the city. Frustrated with this, the Acolytes come up with a plan to remove T'Challa from the throne and hire an assassin the sneak into the Royal Palace. The assassin manages to stab T'Challa in the chest, and alerted by the intrusion, Wasp (now in her cybernetic body) attacks the assassin. T'Challa is critically injured and the only way he can survive is if he becomes a zombie, so Wasp bites him. With her hunger returning, Wasp tries to eat Lisa but is stopped by T'Challa and he joins her in eating the assassin instead.<\/p><p>A few weeks later, Reynolds, Hawkeye and Forge release T'Challa due to the leader of the Acolytes trying to kill them. However, they get caught and pre-occupied with the arrival of the Zombie Galacti. After fighting and defeating the zombies with the help of Spider-Man and Luke Cage who are cured of their hunger, they retreat to a new Wakanda and seal the zombies out of the palace by using a force field to keep them out. However, Gladiator and Bruce Banner are trapped inside as well and Gladiator dies when he attacks T'Challa. T'Challa and the others realise they are not well-mannered enough to protect the portal that the zombies come through and Reynolds reveals that T'Challa's dead son T'Channa is dressed as Colonel America and that Reynolds and Forge have planted Colonel America's brain in his son's body. T'Channa attacks his father but is then reminded of who he is.<\/p><p>The zombies then return and release the force field and T'Challa and the group defeat them, but Iron Man manages to get through. After Banner deactivates the force field, the zombies get through to the survivors, but realise they are not hungry. However, during the fight before, T'Challa gets smashed, which left him with only with his arm, leg, chest, neck and head attached and Wasp crushed from the waist up. After the zombies cope with their newly found humanity, the Hulk breaks into the room, eats Reynolds and kills Iron Man, Phoenix, Firelord and Hawkeye before being stopped by Spider-Man, Giant Man and Wolverine.<\/p><p>After getting a new body by Forge, the zombies help the survivors get supplies and breed in other dimensions. However, Malcolm Cortez, the leader of the Acolytes reveals he was behind the assassination attempt on T'Challa, T'Channa's death and a plot to kill K'Shamba, Panther's grandson. He says he likes this way of life and wants to get rid of the zombie plague and sends T'Challa to another dimension. T'Challa arrives on the reality Earth-Z on the Skrull home world where he converts the entire species and leads his own horde against this Earth's Avengers where he is slain and his arm mounted on the Avenger Tower as a trophy.<\/p><h3>Legacy Virus Merged With Warlock (Earth-8545)<\/h3><p>T'Challa is the son of T'Chaka, late king of the African nation Wakanda. When lawless ivory hunter Ulysses Klaw murdered T'Chaka in an attempt to possess the country's rare Vibranium deposit, a grief-stricken T'Challa swore vengeance and succeeded in thwarting the butcher's raid. In the process, the young prince destroyed Klaw's hand. T'Challa returned to his homeland after recieving a degree in physics ready to assume the mantle of leadership. To do so, he needed to defeat six of Wakanda's greatest warriors in unarmed combat, and obtain the secret heart-shaped herb that grants the country's chieftains their powers. Successfully carrying out the dual challenge, T'Challa donned the ceremonial garb of the Black Panther, totem of the Wakandan people. Under T'Challa, Wakanda has become one of the wealthiest and technologically advanced nations on the planet. After meeting Captain America, the Panther was offered membership in the Avengers.<\/p><h3>Ruins (Earth-9591)<\/h3><p>He is known as T'Challa des Wakandas and is a member of the Black Panther Party imprisoned alongside Bobby Seale and Huey P.

During the Vision's assault on the Avengers, Black Panther fought against him alongside his teammates.<\/p><h3>Earth X - (Earth-9997)<\/h3><p>The history of the Black Panther in this reality is similar to that of the Panther in the 616 mainstream. However, in this reality, the heart shaped herbs that granted him his powers also grant them to anyone else who takes them. Due to the nature of his mutation, however, T'Challa's powers are partially subconscious. In the recent history of this reality, Captain America gives T'Challa the Cosmic Cube of Safe Keepings as he believes that Panther would not use the device or give it to anyone else. During this time, he marries Storm and humanity begins to mutate due to the Terrigen Mists in the Earth's atmosphere. Due to this, T'Challa has more of a panther appearance while the animals in Wakanda which were part of a wildlife reserve that Panther set up, began to mutate as well becoming humanoid creatures known as Ani-Men. When the Skrull begin to take over the United States, Captain America asks T'Challa to give him the Cosmic Cube. Out of respect for his friend, he denies his friend's request and does not involve himself in the final battle against the Skrulls. After the death of the celestial embryo in the Earth's core, the axis shift of the Earth turns Africa into a frozen wasteland, but thanks to Beast's technology, Wakanda maintains its tropical ecosystem and keeps out most threats.<\/p><p>When Mar-vel comes to Wakanda in search of the Cosmetic Cube to destroy Death, T'Challa refuses to give him the Cube. It isn't until Storm is killed by a Wendigo attack and suddenly brought back to life that Mar-vel reveals that the Cube is responsible for that and the mutation of the Ani-Men because it was acting on Panther's wants. This revelation mortifies Panther and he hands the Cube over to Mar-vel who leaves to help the Wakandans relocate to the Savage Land so that they can escape the frequent Wendigo attacks that keep occurring. On the way to the Savage Land, Black Panther is followed by the Wendigo. He defeats them and discovers that they are really the Multiple Man in disguise. T'Challa and Storm help build a new Wakandan nation in the Savage Land with the help of everyone who travels with them. They are attacked by Belasco and the Dire Wraiths but are quickly saved by Mar-vel and his friends. A few months later, T'Challa accompanies Storm to the wedding of Medusa and King Britain, where they meet Bloodstorm. She asks Storm to perform a blood transfusion to cure her of her vampirism. Storm agrees to the procedure and it is unknown what happens to Black Panther went after this point.<\/p><h3>Marvel Manga-verse (Earth- 2301)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637720\" data-ratio=\"1.4472843450479\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637720\"><img alt=\"Earth-2301 Mangaverse\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 626w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 442w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Earth-2301 Mangaverse\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 626w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/15776\/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Earth-2301 Mangaverse<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In the Marvel Manga-verse, T\u2019Challa is still King of Wakanda and when calling upon the help of the God Qamatha, he can transform into a Were-Panther.

Lucas engaged in many gang fights with The Diablos, a rival gang.

Captain Rackham blames Lucas for being demoted when a new warden dislikes how the prison is run.

While the Avengers were off-planet, the mad titan <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos <\/a>decided to invade Earth. Prior to Thanos' invasion, Luke decided to get back into the Heroes for Hire business. He offered internships to <a href=\"\/avengers-academy\/4060-57354\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57354\">Avengers Academy<\/a> graduates, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ava-ayala\/4005-80709\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80709\">Ava Ayala<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/power-man-alvarez\/4005-71023\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71023\">Victor Alvarez<\/a>.<\/p><p>After preventing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/parnival-plunder\/4005-23412\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23412\">Parnival Plunder<\/a> from stealing robot parts, Luke and his interns have a run-in with the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/doctor-octopus\/4005-1485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">\"Superior\" Spider-Man<\/a>. This \"superior\" Spider-Man is really Doctor Octopus with his mind implanted into Peter Parker's body (readers commonly refer to him as \"SpOck\"). During the encounter, SpOck labeled Luke and his interns \"hired thugs\", which led to an argument with Victor Alvarez. The argument was interrupted by Ava, who agreed with SpOck and decided to resign from the internship, stating that as heroes, they all should be doing more.<\/p><p>Luke respected her decision and allowed her to leave. He then attempted to calm Victor down, who was still fuming from SpOck's comments, by treating him to coffee. Luke agreed with Victor that SpOck's comments were inappropriate. He also agreed with Ava's comments about \"doing more.\" He told Victor about his retirement from the Avengers (to take care of his daughter) and how since doing so, he hasn't done much to make the world a better place for her to grow up in. Victor misinterpreted this as Luke saying he no longer wants to be in the Hero for Hire business and stormed out of the restaurant.<\/p><p>Later, the streets of Manhattan are flooded with demons led by Thanos' general <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/proxima-midnight\/4005-90522\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90522\">Proxima Midnight<\/a>. Luke immediately began to combat the demons alongside several other heroes who were in Manhattan at the time. SpOck, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/monica-rambeau\/4005-11337\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Monica Rambeau<\/a> and \"Spider Hero\" (<a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/blade\/4005-7570\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7570\">Blade<\/a>), all joined Luke to fend off the demons. Luke also combats Proxima for a while and at one point, gained the upper hand, but was ultimately put down by the powerful general. During the battle, his resilience and determination to win angered Proxima, and when she was unable to kill him (due to his unbreakable skin) Thanos ordered her to return to base. Another one of Thanos' generals, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/ebony-maw\/4005-90606\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90606\">Ebony Maw<\/a>, joined the fight and used his special abilities to manipulate an infected <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/doctor-strange\/4005-1456\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange<\/a> into summoning <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/shuma-gorath\/4005-14000\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14000\">Shuma-Gorath<\/a>! However, the multidimensional demon was not at its full strength. When the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/blue-marvel\/4005-57033\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57033\">Blue Marvel<\/a>, Victor, and Ava later arrived in Manhattan to help clear up the remaining demons, they joined Monica Rambeau and combined their abilities to send Gorath back to it's own dimension. During the battle, Victor dubbed them the \"Mighty Avengers\". The team remained together until the events of Secret Wars, when an incursion seemingly destroyed the Marvel Universe, but was actually reshaped and luckily returned to normal soon.<\/p><h3>Back with Iron Fist<\/h3><p>More recently, after the events of Secret Wars, both Iron Fist and Luke restarted their Heroes for Hire company.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Powers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3448806\" data-ratio=\"1.1435810810811\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3448806\"><img alt=\"Luke's infamous unbreakable skin is his greatest asset.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-width=\"559\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg 592w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg 559w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Luke's infamous unbreakable skin is his greatest asset.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg 592w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3448806-9697262678-28873.jpg 559w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px\" data-width=\"559\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Luke's infamous unbreakable skin is his greatest asset.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As a result of volunteering for a chemical experiment involving AVX, Luke Cage possesses formidable superhuman capabilities.

After Luke nearly kills the bus driver he believes responsible for the accident, Jessica is forced to reveal that she actually killed Reva while under the control of <a href=\"\/purple-man\/4005-3227\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3227\">Kilgrave<\/a>. This news causes their relationship to end, with Luke telling Jessica that she's a piece of shit for deceiving him.<\/p><p>He returns in the final two episodes of the series, where he tries to help Jessica track down Kilgrave. Though it initially seems like he has forgiven her, it later turns out that he was actually under Kilgrave's control the entire time. A brutal fight ensues, and Jessica manages to save her own life after knocking out Luke with a shotgun blast to the face. He is later revived by <a href=\"\/claire-temple\/4005-13384\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13384\">Claire Temple<\/a>, and goes back on the run again without saying goodbye to Jessica.<\/p><h3>Luke Cage<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5473585\" data-ratio=\"1.4192654192654\" data-width=\"1443\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1443px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5473585\"><img alt=\"The solo series\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 1443w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 1352w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 676w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The solo series\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 1443w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 1352w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 676w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/5473585-8757337342-marvel.jpeg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The solo series<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Mike Colter reprises his role in the <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/luke-cage\/4075-654\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-654\"><em>Luke Cage<\/em><\/a> solo series.

As a result of this the two leave in different apartments though their relationship is still intact.<\/p><h2><b>Powers and Abilities<\/b><\/h2><p>Misty Knight is highly skilled in martial arts and is a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, with police combat training. She also has near-perfect aim with firearms, and possesses superb detective skills. Her bionic arm is 75 times superhumanly stronger than a normal arm, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. However, since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.<\/p><p>Her original bionic right arm is an alloy of Antarctic <a href=\"\/vibranium\/4055-40919\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">vibranium<\/a> and diamond; at close range it can liquefy all known metals including adamantium. It is also now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to Iron Man's armor. It can also apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold also seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen. Iron Man also revealed the arm also displays technopathic capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots. Following her \"pregnancy\", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.<\/p><p><b>Physical Attributes<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Height: 5'9''<\/li><li>Weight: 136 lbs<\/li><li>Eyes: Brown<\/li><li>Hair: Black<\/li><\/ul><h2><b>Alternate Realities<\/b><\/h2><h3><b>Earth-295 - Age of Apocalypse<\/b><\/h3><p>In the <a href=\"\/age-of-apocalypse\/4045-40752\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40752\">Age of Apocalypse<\/a> she was an armless human living on the streets captured and chained by <a href=\"\/scavengers\/4005-51092\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51092\">Scavengers<\/a> so they could eat her later.

Trained privately by the greatest masters of various disciplines, Chinese and otherwise, Shang had limited contact with his parents.<\/p><p>When he did see his father, his father told him that all of his training was being directed toward some sort of great humanitarian goal, as his father manipulated Shang into thinking that he was a philanthropist. When the time finally came for Shang to face the outside world and carry out this mission, he was transported to England, where his mission was assassination. He knew nothing other than to honor his father with complete loyalty, so after stealthily sneaking into his target's home, he killed who he thought was an evil man in one swift strike. British secret agent <a href=\"..\/..\/sir-dennis-nayland-smith\/29-36670\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir Dennis Nayland-Smith<\/a> arrived on the scene in time to catch Shang, but of course couldn't keep him there.

When they were finally intercepted, Orka brashly engaged the band on his own and was fatally wounded by the Doombot. Following his friend\u2019s passing, Shang lost his restraints and viciously beat down each member of the Headmen, finishing by destroying the Doombot that the team was initially hired to recover. Afterwards, Shang began to develop a more intimate relationship with fellow teammate Tarantula.<\/p><p>When the team was sent to the Savage Land on another mission, Shang and Tarantula furthered their romantic relationship. Although he resented his emotions at first and even despised Tarantula\u2019s violent tendencies, she eventually convinced him to embrace their bond. During this time, Shang also showed a marked increase in aggression which may have resulted from the death of Orka as well as his strained relationship with Tarantula.<\/p><h3>Heroes for Hire: World War Hulk<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3500999\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.95924764890282\" data-width=\"1276\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1276px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3500999\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 1276w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 1276w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/3500999-h4h_wwh.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>After Humbug\u2019s transformation in the Savage Land by the insect hive mind, he informed the Heroes for Hire of the imminent threat posed by the Hulk\u2019s Warbound and especially by <a href=\"\/miek\/4005-43226\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43226\">Miek <\/a>and his <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/brood-queen\/4005-14746\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14746\">Brood Queen<\/a>.

As a result, both were subject to torture by the brood while Shang and the rest of the team were set free.<\/p><p>The Heroes for Hire assist the help of former member Paladin in order to rescue their teammates. After seeing what the Warbound had done to Tarantula however, Shang decided to go back on his own to finish off Humbug. What he ends up finding is that the Brood Queen had tricked Humbug by turning him into a living incubator for her eggs. Gruesomely mutated, he begged Shang to help end his pain and suffering. At the same time, Humbug admitted that he never wanted to hurt Colleen, but he hated Tarantula and thought she deserved the torment. Hearing this, Shang snapped Humbug\u2019s neck without hesitation, killing his former friend out of rage and mercy. The Heroes for Hire once again disbanded shortly afterwards.<\/p><h3>Shadowland<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4307634\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"1.1688888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4307634\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.png 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.jpg 821w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.png 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.jpg 821w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4307634-shadowlandspiderman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>During the events of Shadowland, Shang-Chi joined the other heroes of New York in an effort to stop Daredevil. The heroes confronted their former friend who, unbeknownst to them, was under demonic influence. Negotiations broke down rather quickly after a tense encounter, and Daredevil demonstrated his new found martial prowess and physical abilities by effortlessly defeating both Shang-Chi and Iron Fist. Later on, Shang assisted Spider-Man in fighting <a href=\"\/mister-negative\/4005-49969\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49969\">Mr. Negative<\/a> and his <a href=\"\/the-inner-demons\/4060-56281\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56281\">Inner Demons<\/a>. The Chinatown crime-lord was seeking to take advantage of the situation in Shadowland by expanding his territory. During the fight, Shang was caught by Mr. Negative who attempted to corrupt him with his ability. In a shocking turn of events, Shang ends up absorbing a portion of Mr. Negative's powers, gaining some influence over the Inner Demons as well. However, the negative energies appeared to corrupt Shang's mind, fueling a desire to kill Mr. Negative to take all of the villains powers and follow in the footsteps of his father. He also intended on using the Inner Demons to fight Daredevil and the Hand, although he planned on taking over the latter's role in subjugating the city. Spider-Man confronted Shang-Chi, saving Mr. Negative, and the two engaged in a brief fight before Peter decided to lower his fists. As Shang-Chi was about to slay his former ally, he was able to regain control and dissipate Mr. Negative's influence. Shang-Chi was seen again in the final confrontation with Daredevil, fighting the Hand and aiding the other heroes in finally reverting their friend to his former self.<\/p><h3>Secret Avengers: Eyes of the Dragon<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343140\" data-ratio=\"1.4344444444444\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343140\"><img alt=\"Secret Avengers\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg 446w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Secret Avengers\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/33913\/1343140-89_secret_avengers_7.jpg 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Secret Avengers<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Shang Chi is asleep when suddenly he senses that he is not alone. He wakes up to find several ninjas of the Hai-Dai Order attacking. He fights well, but there are many.<\/p><p>Fortunately, an ally appears in the form of the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-prince-of-orphans\/29-46789\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prince of Orphans<\/a>. He is there on the behest of <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-america\/29-1442\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Rogers<\/a>, and Shang-Chi is keen to discover why. Two days earlier, <a href=\"..\/..\/beast\/29-1462\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank McCoy<\/a> passed a message to Steve Rogers from the Prince of Orphans. It concerned a temple he'd come across filled with dead monks.He had heard rumors that the Hai-Dai were responsible. Steve knew that the Hai-Dai were supposed to have disbanded, but the Prince informed Steve that they were looking for the Eyes of the Dragon, and if that was the case then there was trouble on its way. In the present, Shang-Chi joins Steve aboard the Secret Avengers' floating HQ. Shang is surprised to discover that his father might be alive, or at least on the verge of being brought back from the dead. Along with Steve and the Black Widow, Shang-Chi travels to Hong Kong where the team infiltrates the International Finance Centre on a mission to retrieve the eyes.<\/p><p>Inside, they discover that they've been lured there on purpose and are attacked by more Hai-Dai ninjas. Elsewhere, Shang-Chi's father is with Shadow Council Director Thorndrake and Max Fury. He is half-way to being brought back fully from the dead. Fury receives a call. One of the Shadow Council's teams has found the real Eyes of the Dragon, so all that is needed now is to get their hands on Shang-Chi.<\/p><p>As the three heroes fought against the numerically superior Hai-Dai, Steve and Natasha are cut off from Shang. Overwhelmed by their numbers and with his allies out of reach, Shang eventually fell prey to a blow from behind and was captured. On board an unspecified aircraft the Hai-Dai stood guard around Shang-Chi. Right as one of the ninjas attempted to execute him however, <a href=\"..\/..\/ant-man-ogrady\/29-6774\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ant-Man<\/a> emerged from a strand of his hair and two quickly dispatched the crew. When the team regroups on board the Quincarrier, Beast reveals that the real name of Shang-Chi's father is <a href=\"..\/..\/fu-manchu\/29-14083\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zheng Zu<\/a>. Zu was an evil sorcerer from ancient times who gained his longevity through using the <a href=\"..\/..\/eyes-of-the-dragon\/18-56579\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eyes of the Dragon<\/a> and draining the life essence of blood relatives.<\/p><p>They deduce that the Shadow Council are working with Zheng Zu to target Shang-Chi and complete his resurrection. Shang-Chi\u2019s father is suddenly spotted attacking civilians on the streets of Hong Kong in broad daylight, and the team heads down to intercept this act of terrorism. Shang is suspicious of the obtrusive attack, but the heroes realize too late that this was nothing more than a diversion to capture <a href=\"..\/..\/sharon-carter\/29-38227\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sharon Carter<\/a>. The Shadow Council later offers the safe return of Sharon in exchange for Shang-Chi.<\/p><p>Later on as he spared with Steve, Shang made it clear that he will willingly turn himself over to the Shadow Council and his father for Sharon's safety. The Secret Avengers received directions from <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/john-steele\/4005-57571\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57571\">John Steele<\/a>, requesting that Shang and Steve meet on a rooftop to make the exchange. Despite going along willingly, Steele incapacitated Shang with a shock rifle to prevent any possibility of resistance.<\/p><p>Steve calls in the rest of the Secret Avengers and forces Steele to retreat with a captured Shang-Chi. As Zheng Zu prepared his sacrificial ritual, Moon Knight revealed himself as a disguised guard and quickly called in the rest of the team. During the ensuing battle, the Prince of Orphans seemingly interrupts the ritual and kills Zheng Zu. In the aftermath, Shang bid farewell to the Steve and Sharon, grateful for their help in stopping his father and agreeing to return the favor if ever needed.<\/p><h3>Secret Avengers: No Zone<\/h3><p>Sometime after thwarting his father's resurrection, Shang-Chi rejoined the Secret Avengers on a mission in the No Zone. Along with Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter, Shang was sent to retrieve a small canister of transmatter obtained by the Shadow Council, said to be powerful enough to turn the Earth into a smouldering star. Shang was seen brutally disabling and maiming all hostiles he came across in order to prevent them from regrouping, but he resented being forced to act as a \u201cthug\u201d, having initially agreed on taking part in a mission of stealth and extraction.<\/p><p>When the team arrived at a crossroads with two ventilation shafts, Shang used his heightened senses to detect that one shaft was cooler than the other, suggesting it led to the flight deck. Steve took the opportunity to retort that Shang wasn\u2019t there to be a thug; he was there to be an Avenger. The heroes are ultimately able to capture both the Council\u2019s inter-universal space craft and the canister of transmatter.<\/p><p>During the events of <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/fear-itself\/4045-56288\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56288\">Fear Itself<\/a>, Shang-Chi is also among the many heroes defending Washington from the army of <a href=\"..\/..\/sin\/29-28057\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skadi<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3443987\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3443987\"><img alt=\"A coming of Spiders\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A coming of Spiders\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3443987-5956839376-13151.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A coming of Spiders<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Before the events of <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/spider-island\/4045-56485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56485\">Spider-Island<\/a>, the new <a href=\"\/madame-web\/4005-10670\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10670\">Madame Web<\/a>, <a href=\"\/julia-carpenter\/4005-16197\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Julia Carpenter<\/a> asked Shang-Chi to train Spider-Man in martial arts to compensate for the loss of his spider-sense. He donned special magnetic gloves and shoes during their sparring sessions to help Spider-Man develop a unique fighting style that complemented his spider powers.<\/p><p>With ordinary New Yorkers developing the same powers as himself, Spider-Man is forced to capitalize on Shang-Chi's training in several situations. When the wall-crawler's spider-sense returned, it worked in harmony with the techniques Shang taught him, turning the tide in a decisive battle against <a href=\"\/kaine\/4005-8667\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Tarantula<\/a>.<\/p><p>As the events of Spider-Island continued to unfold, Shang-Chi became infected by the spider plague. Developing the same set of powers as Spider-Man, Shang fought alongside other heroes in defending New York against the threat of spider-powered criminals.<\/p><p>During this time, he had nightmares involving the <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/immortal-weapons\/65-51583\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immortal Weapons<\/a> and saw himself as a spider attacking innocent people in visions. When he speaks with Madame Web, she left him only with a cryptic fortune. After joining Iron Fist in combat, the two discovered that they had been sharing the same nightmares. Their meeting is cut short as the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-bride-of-nine-spiders\/29-46787\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bride of Nine Spiders<\/a> joined the fray and asked Danny to speak with her on a rooftop in private. Sensing something was wrong, Shang followed the two and witnessed the Bride attack and incapacitate Iron Fist. Jumping to his friend's defense, Shang utilized his newly acquired spider powers to easily pin down the Bride, but is caught off-guard and knocked out by his assailant's super natural fighting technique.<\/p><h3>The Web of Deceit<\/h3><p>Awakening later on at his apartment and aided by <a href=\"..\/..\/silver-sable\/29-7608\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Sable<\/a>, Shang-Chi concluded that the Bride of Nine Spiders was the source of his nightmares. He identified a street sign in one of his dreams and tracks the Bride to an abandoned house in Hamilton Heights. The house had adverse effects on Shang's senses, weakening his reflexes despite his acquired spider powers. After overcoming several hallucinations and physical traps, he was able to find the Bride and the other Immortal Weapons whom she cocooned in webbing. While Shang was able to hold his own against the Bride despite his affliction, he took the opportunity to free Iron Fist and increase their odds.<\/p><p>Badly weakened due to being incapacitated, Danny is nevertheless able to muster enough chi energy to strike the Bride with his signature punch, setting her up to receive a vicious knock-out kick from Shang. As Danny attempted to heal the Bride of Nine Spiders, Shang-Chi succumbs to the spider plague and passes out. Simultaneously, <a href=\"..\/..\/the-decapitator\/29-74554\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ai Apaec<\/a> descends from the ceiling and reveals himself as the true mastermind behind the kidnapping of the Immortal Weapons. The South American chimera god explains that he has been working with the <a href=\"..\/..\/queen\/29-41418\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Queen<\/a>, and the Bride was offered as payment for his services. As Iron Fist readied himself to face this threat alone, Shang-Chi recovered behind him ready to lend his deadly hands of Kung Fu - all six of them, thanks to his spider transformation.<\/p><h3>The Zen of Spiders<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3444005\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3444005\"><img alt=\"Shang-Chi vs Ai Apaec\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shang-Chi vs Ai Apaec\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111112802\/3444005-5838275488-13200.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Shang-Chi vs Ai Apaec<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>With his newly acquired spider mutation, Shang-Chi held off Ai Apaec long enough for Iron fist to free the remaining Immortal Weapons. Although his transformation furthers throughout the fight, Shang was able to maintain focus and press against his monstrous opponent. Iron Fist rejoined the fight bringing with him <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/fat-cobra\/29-46785\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fat Cobra<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/dog-brother-1\/29-46786\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dog Brother<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/tigers-beautiful-daughter\/29-46788\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tiger's Beautiful Daughter<\/a>, and a resuscitated Bride of Nine Spiders. Despite their numerical advantage, the Immortal Weapons were weakened by their imprisonment and easily dispatched by Ai Apaec.<\/p><p>Shang desperately fights against the Queen's influence as his spider transformation nears completion. Seeing this, Danny rushed to his friend's aid and used his chi to help revert Shang's mutation. Given the greater threat at hand, Shang asked the Immortal Weapons to leave as they are needed to defend the city and faces off against Ai Apaec on his own. While his spider powers were gone, Shang felt his Kung Fu had been redoubled. Realizing that he was still no match for the chimera god in a head on fight, he distracted his opponent with small strikes and focused on destroy support beams that held the burning structure in place, eventually crushing Ai Apaec beneath the rubble. Shang-Chi returned to the city after his victory and continued fighting against the spider threat with his allies.<\/p><p>During the decisive battle against the Queen in her final form, Shang-Chi showed up with the Immortal Weapons as reinforcements. This was unforeseen by Madame Web, who reiterated the futility of the heroes' efforts. Upon hearing her loss of confidence, Shang asked her to join them in their fight, to make her own future for once.<\/p><h3>Joining the Avengers<\/h3><p>Following the events of Avengers vs X-Men, Captain America and Iron Man seek to make a new, bigger, stronger Avenger's roster. Shang-Chi was among the fist to be chosen for this new initiative. He gladly accepted an offer from Steve Rogers and saw it as an opportunity to further challenge himself. Although Stark acknowledged the Master of Kung-Fu as an astonishing hand-to-hand combatant, he was keen to take advantage of Shang's mastery of traditional weaponry and providing him with personalized equipment.<\/p><h3>The Garden<\/h3><p>During a mission to Mars, several core members of the Avengers are captured by <a href=\"\/the-garden\/4060-59508\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59508\">The Garden<\/a>, leaving Captain America to assemble the rest of the team to mount a counterattack.

During the battle, he faced off against the world-razing robot <a href=\"\/aleph\/4005-86672\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86672\">Aleph<\/a> and critically damages its left leg.

Shang felt it more appropriate to speak with the Uni-Power's host, Tamara Devoux, and 'lured' her out with pie. Using meditative techniques, he helped piece together Tamara's traumatizing past. It was revealed afterwards that the Uni-Power manifested at this time because of the Earth's pivotal role in events to come, and it chose Tamara as a host because she was dying, much like the universe itself.<\/p><p>Later on, Shang and a team of Avengers went to a casino in Macau to investigate <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/aim\/4060-13497\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">A.I.M. <\/a>activities. While following his own leads, Shang was attacked by ninjas lead by a mysterious armored figure. After utilizing a pair of electrified nunchacku provided by Stark, Shang defeated their leader and took his helmet as a souvenir. He reveals to his teammates that A.I.M. was bidding to hire mercenaries, and that the insidious organization was preparing for a large scale conflict. He is next seen with the rest of the Avengers in combat at an Origin Bomb site which had gone active.<\/p><h3>Infinity<\/h3><p>Shang-Chi was with the Avengers when they joined the Galactic Council to fight against the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/builders\/4060-60019\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60019\">Builders<\/a> and their crusade against all life in the universe. When several allies were captured by the enemy, Shang formed a rescue team with Black Widow, Spider-Woman and Manifold. Wielding a pair of energy projecting gauntlets, Shang's timely intervention prevented his friends from being vaporized by an Aleph.<\/p><p>After the Builders were defeated by the alliance forces, the Avengers returned to Earth with their new Galactic Council allies to face off against an even bigger threat back home - an untimely assault by <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/thanos\/4005-7607\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos<\/a>. Shang was sent along with Black Widow and Manifold the infiltrate the Peak and shut down Thanos' first line of defense. However, the team was intercepted by the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/black-dwarf\/4005-90284\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90284\">Black Dwarf<\/a> and a complement of guards. As Manifold returned to grab reinforcements, Shang and Natasha managed to defeat the entire security force, save the general who proved to be too much for even the Master of Kung Fu. The combined might of Gladiator, Ronan and other Council members eventually made short work of the Black Dwarf and allowed Shang and the infiltration team to complete their mission.<\/p><h3>Avengers World<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3445162\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4877777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3445162\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg 645w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg 430w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg 645w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/3445162-avenworld2014003morales.jpg 430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>With the threat of both the Builders and Thanos thwarted, Shang-Chi was sent to Madripoor along with Wolverine, Falcon and Black Widow to deal with the civil unrest. During the mission, Shang stumbled upon a group of Hand ninjas at a temple, where the <a href=\"\/gorgon\/4005-3777\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3777\">Gorgon <\/a>was being inaugurated as their new leader. Furthermore, it was revealed that Madripoor is actually sitting atop the head of an ancient dragon who was now under command of the Gorgon. Knowing he was facing an incredibly powerful opponent, Shang tried his best to attack the Gorgon from the shadows and utilized a pair of energy generating bracers. Despite initially having an advantage, Shang knew his efforts were not enough. The Gorgon eventually counterattacked and severely injured the Master of Kung Fu, tossing him off the side of a cliff.<\/p><p>It was later revealed that Shang-Chi had been rescued by agents of China's first response and intelligence gathering organization, <a href=\"\/s-p-e-a-r\/4060-60868\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60868\">S.P.E.A.R.<\/a> As he recuperated aboard their ship, the Circle, the rest of the Avengers teamed up with <a href=\"\/the-ascendant\/4060-60864\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60864\">the Ascendant<\/a> in combating the Gorgon's forces who were attacking China.

Taking care not to harm the city atop its head, Shang quickly dispatched the beast before plucking the Gorgon along with the Hand's temple from its head, tossing them into the distance. He presumably helps drag the beast back to where it belonged so Madripoor could be restored to its original geographic location.<\/p><h3>Deadly Hands of Kung Fu: Out of the Past<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4409425\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4409425\"><img alt=\"Returning to the games of deceit and death\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Returning to the games of deceit and death\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/41957\/4409425-9608389478-Deadl.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Returning to the games of deceit and death<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In London's Chinatown, we see Leiko Wu chased by a group of eccentric assassins lead by Razor Fist, who viciously slaughtered her after a brief struggle. Shang-Chi is on a mission in the Rocky Mountains to capture <a href=\"\/crossbones\/4005-3225\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\">Crossbones<\/a>, and after taking down his target, he received a call from Steve Rogers delivering the bad news. Leiko's demise puts Shang into a slump and forces him to seek answers regarding her death. This reunites him with the Sons of the Tiger and eventually makes him a target of several assassins. After attempting to interrogate one of his assailants only to have them bite a cyanide capsule embedded in their molar, he plucked the rigged tooth from a remaining assassin and forced him to reveal a name: the <a href=\"\/white-dragon\/4005-27884\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27884\">White Dragon<\/a>. Black Jack Tarr and MI6 show up shortly after in a mock attempt to dissuade Shang from pursuing revenge, but they ultimately decided to stay out of Shang's way while keeping him under surveillance.<\/p><p>His investigation eventually reunites him with an old enemy, <a href=\"\/skull-crusher\/4005-34523\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34523\">Skull-Crusher<\/a>, who reveals to be both Leiko's lover and the target of her espionage activities. Shang refused to believe his words despite Skull-Crusher's willingness to aid him. When he finally encounters Razor Fist and his band of assassins, Shang is joined by his friends and former teammates, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight, who help fight them off. The Master of Kung Fu is shocked to learn that the assassins use a form of ancient Chinese black magic known as Mao Shan Pai. Asking his friends to look further into the source of this black magic, Shang himself tracks down the White Dragon and meets him face to face.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Powers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1928139-secavn018_cov_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1928139\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1928139-secavn018_cov_col.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1928139\"><img alt=\"Deadly Hands of Kung Fu\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1928139-secavn018_cov_col.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1928139-secavn018_cov_col.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadly Hands of Kung Fu\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1928139-secavn018_cov_col.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101073\/1928139-secavn018_cov_col.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Deadly Hands of Kung Fu<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Although possessing no superpowers, Shang-Chi has a lifetime of combat training behind him and is an expert in all known forms of terrestrial martial arts, enabling him to equal and best many superhumans. He is highly revered as the \"Master of Kung-Fu.\" Although he prefers to fight empty-handed, Shang-Chi can also formidably use any martial arts weapon and is skilled at improvising weapons out of ordinary objects in his environment. Shang-Chi is also a skilled teacher, having most famously trained Spider-Man to become a skilled martial artist and having helped him develop a unique fighting style that complemented his spider powers.<\/p><p>Shang-Chi is a master of meditation and relaxation techniques as well, allowing him to receive psychic premonitions, limit the spread of toxins in his blood stream, and render his pain receptors insensitive. He was able to use his mastery of meditation in a psychotherapy session with the new Captain Universe in order to reveal her repressed memories. His understanding of metaphysics is further elaborated on when Shang becomes one of the few normal humans capable of communicating with<a href=\"\/builder-machine-code\/4015-56177\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56177\"> Builder Machine code<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Abilities<\/h3><p>Shang's mastery of chi allows him to disperse physical trauma across his entire body (as opposed to accumulating at any single point) and strike with enough force to break through reinforced steel. On many occasions, he has also demonstrated the ability to dodge and deflect bullets from automatic weapons after they've been fired, and he is quick and agile enough to keep up with the likes of Spider-Man.<\/p><p>While possessing no superhuman senses, Shang-Chi is highly attuned to his surroundings thanks to his training and having spent most of his life thwarting his father's assassins. He is able to pinpoint the breath sounds and heart beats of silent aggressors, as well as the distant loading of firearms by gunmen. On one occasion he was even able to detect the precise location of Jean Grey and Cyclops, cloaked by the former's psionic powers. He has also demonstrated the ability to sense small changes in the environment that would be unnoticed by most, as demonstrated during his mission in the No Zone.<\/p><p>Due to his training, Shang-Chi is also less susceptible to mental attacks than most humans, having been able to resist the influence of the Queen during Spider Island, and maintaining autonomy after being converted by Mister Negative's powers.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Equipment<\/h2><p>Shang-Chi is usually seen with a pair of bracers made of an unknown material, but known to be durable enough to deflect bullets. He is skilled with (and often utilizes) a wide variety of weapons, including the nunchaku, various types of swords, bo staff, Kali sticks, throwing stars and knives. After joining the Avengers, Tony Stark provided him with a pair of high tech nunchaku capable of discharging electricity as well as a pair of gauntlets capable of projecting energy blades. Recently, it appears that his bracers are also able to generate energy, allowing him to mimic Iron Fist's basic chi-amped punches. Despite his mastery of weapons and their accessibility however, Shang-Chi largely prefers to fight empty handed.<\/p><h2>Alternate Realities<\/h2><h3>Earth-9997<\/h3><p>In the Earth X reality Shang Chi is known as Tao and is a member of Sunfire's Xen.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":"{'api_detail_url': 'https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-13893\/', 'id': 13893, 'name': 'Shang Chi, Master of Kung Fu!', 'issue_number': '15'}","gender":"Male","image":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/3644773-shangchi%20-%20deadly%20hands%20of%20kung%20fu.png","name":"Shang-Chi","publisher":"Marvel","real_name":"Zheng Shang-Chi","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/shang-chi\/4005-12716\/","year":1973.0,"first_appearance_date":"1973-Dec","decades":"The 70s","background":"During the 1970s in the United States, cultural trends included the popularization of Blaxploitation films and Kung-Fu epics.

She spent most of her youth in northern Japan however, being raised by her grandfather. It was her grandfather, Kanji, who would teach her the ways of the samurai.<\/p><p>Upon returning to the New York, Colleen would meet and befriend Danny Rand, also known as the hero <a href=\"\/iron-fist\/4005-1492\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist<\/a>. It was during this time that Colleen's father asked in the help of the Iron Fist. The two already soon became good partners and fought together on the mission that her father had set them out to do.

The two became best friends afterwards.<\/p><p>After a devastating injury in which Misty lost an arm after a bomb blast, Colleen stood by her new friend and helped her through her recovery even though Misty's days as an officer seemed over. Eventually, Misty's arm was replaced by a bionic one, and the two women teamed up to form a partnership as heroes for hire.

Soon a romance blossemed between Colleen and Luke as well as between Misty and Danny Rand (Iron Fist). Colleen's new role as a hero for hire would however put her into conflict against her old friend Iron Fist when both Colleen and Misty were enslaved by <a href=\"\/angar-the-screamer\/4005-32260\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32260\">Angar the Screamer<\/a> and <a href=\"\/master-khan\/4005-12603\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12603\">Master Khan<\/a>, forcing them to fight against their will although they would later recover.

They fought against numerous threads. The team continued to operate after the chaos caused by Onslaught and the apparent deaths of many of the Marvel heroes.

The two of them fought against such super-villains as the Rhino and amazingly won. Succeeding in that, the two girlfriends thought they where back on the right track. It was however during this time that the Super Human Civil War started witch was a conflict over whether or not super-humans should be forced to register with the U.S. government. Colleen and Misty started and became part of a new <a href=\"\/heroes-for-hire\/4060-23588\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes for Hire<\/a> team, authorized by Tony Stark after the Superhero Registration act was passed. Colleen was identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative. The team's main purpose started out to apprehend heroes that had not registered. This brought her into conflict with their former friends and partners Iron Fist and Luke Cage, whom where both on the opposite side of the law. Luckily, the team did not interact with them personally during this time. The team soon grew and had new team-members such as a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/maria-vasquez\/4005-80465\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80465\">Tarantula<\/a>, <a href=\"\/humbug\/4005-30619\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30619\">Humbug<\/a>, <a href=\"\/paladin\/4005-10584\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10584\">Paladin<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/orka\/4005-13400\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13400\">Orka<\/a>.

In her group's more recent mission, Colleen Wing and her team where send to the Savage Land to apprehend Moon-Boy and take him over to the authorities. While the team found Moon-Boy and managed to capture him, Colleen was very much doubting whether or not the should give the creature to the authorities.

During his teen years, Jean-Paul took to stealing and was eventually caught by Raymonde Belmonde. Belmonde took him in and became his mentor, helping Jean-Paul to come to terms with his mutant powers and sexuality. Jean-Paul also spent some time in a circus, becoming a talented trapeze artist and creating the family he never had with his fellow performers. However, Jean-Paul still had quite a bit of pent up anger and frustration within him which he ultimately expressed by joining the separatist Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec movement. Jean-Paul acted as a courier for the Lib\u00e9ration before he reliased that their tactics were too violent when he was forced to save the lives of innocent bystanders from one of their bombs. Jean-Paul quickly severed all ties with the Front after this incident.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29818\/695597-northstar05.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29818\/695597-northstar05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"Meeting his sister\" src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/29818\/695597-northstar05.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Meeting his sister<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Some time later, Jean Paul secretly used his mutant powers to become an Olympic world ski champion, earning him a bundle of fame and wealth.

Jean-Paul also developed a romantic relationship with an, as of yet, unnamed man, and was later asked by <a href=\"\/wolverine\/4005-1440\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine<\/a> to rejoin the X-Men. Although hesitant about being seen as the X-Men's \"queer mascot\", Northstar ultimately agreed after being made aware of the teams tactical need for a member with speed based powers. Once he returned to the X-Men, Northstar assisted the team in defeating the <a href=\"\/sisterhood-of-mutants\/4060-26989\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26989\"> Sisterhood of Mutants<\/a>, and personally dealt with Spiral during their final confrontation at grave site of Jean Grey.<\/p><p>Northstar was later seen during protests that centered around the idea of mutant reproductive rights violations and helped the X-Men defeat the <a href=\"\/dark-avengers\/4060-55990\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\"> \"Avengers\"<\/a> after they came to San Fransisco to enforce <a href=\"\/norman-osborn\/4005-58812\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman Osborn's<\/a> curfew, which he established after branding <a href=\"\/cyclops\/4005-1459\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\"> Cyclops<\/a> as an outlaw.

Cyclops scolded Northstar for this, ordering him to sort deal with his problems. After arranging for Kyle to visit Utopia, it became obvious that a strain had been placed on the relationship. This was partly due to Kyle's uncomfortableness with Utopia and Jean-Paul's strong desire to see him. The two settled on staying in a hotel in San Francisco with Kyle promising to someday return to Utopia.<\/p><h3>Second Coming<\/h3><p><b>For further details see<\/b>: <a href=\"\/second-coming\/4045-55971\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55971\"> Second Coming<\/a><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198938\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.71111111111111\" data-width=\"540\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 540px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198938\"><img alt=\"Entering Limbo\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg 540w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Entering Limbo\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg 540w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6754\/1198938-40f6b23b7bacba61574722ebd6e11e48.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Entering Limbo<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Northstar was among the many mutants present on Utopia when <a href=\"\/nightcrawler\/4005-1461\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\"> Nightcrawler<\/a> sacrificed his life to return to the island with <a href=\"\/hope-summers\/4005-49329\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\"> Hope<\/a>, the first mutant born since M-Day. Northstar comforted fellow teammate <a href=\"\/dazzler\/4005-1498\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\"> Dazzler<\/a> after they discovered Nightcrawler's death and later attended his funeral. Northstar then joined a team lead by <a href=\"\/cannonball\/4005-1496\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1496\"> Cannonball<\/a> into <a href=\"\/limbo\/4020-42990\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42990\"> Limbo<\/a> so that they could rescue <a href=\"\/illyana-rasputin\/4005-8303\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\"> Magik<\/a> who had become trapped there by <a href=\"\/bastion\/4005-40568\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40568\"> Bastion's<\/a> schemes due to her position as one of the X-Men's key teleporters. Upon arrival in Limbo, Northstar scouted the area, noting that the terrain constantly changed and that if they did not hurry it would only be a matter of time before they were spotted.<\/p><p>The team was soon separated after being attacked by a number of demons, though Northstar managed to find and assist Dazzler in battle. The two were soon attacked and subdued by <a href=\"\/gambit\/4005-1499\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1499\"> Gambit<\/a>, who had succumbed to his Death persona. Under Gambit's control, Northstar and Dazzler attempted to defeat the rest of their teammates, but were ultimately freed after Illyanna used her soul sword to subdue Gambit, once she had been freed by <a href=\"\/pixie\/4005-40673\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\"> Pixie<\/a>. With their mission complete, the team wasted no time in leaving the hellish realm of Limbo in order to return to Utopia.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/curse-of-the-mutants\/4045-56136\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56136\"> Curse of the Mutants<\/a><\/h3><p>Northstar is part of an attack wave to an island populated by vampires. The goal is to retrieve <a href=\"\/dracula\/4005-7206\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\"> Dracula's<\/a> body to resurrect him. The mission is considered a failure because he was forced to stake all the vampires at super-speed to protect Dazzler, who's powers were being blocked by the vampires. Because of this Emma is unable to read any of their minds. He is later sent in with the other X-Men for another attack. This attack is more successful as he grabs all the vampires light-bending medallions, which was what blocked Dazzler's powers. Without them Dazzler was able to set off a large blast of light at the vampires, killing them, as Northstar proudly shouts \"go team Jacob\", a reference to Jacob Black from Twilight.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/quarantine\/4045-56393\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56393\"> Quarantine<\/a><\/h3><p>Shortly after Second Coming, Utopia came down with a nasty disease. During this time the mutants that weren't on the island were asked to be the X-Men, while all the mutants on Utopia could not leave. A virus was engineered by the Sublime Corporation to finish off the mutant species. The virus not only has flu like symptoms, it also has a power dampening effect on the mutants powers. With a growing number of infected mutants, which included Anole, Wolverine and Iceman, Cyclops quarantined the island in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. To assuage growing public fear of a flu epidemic and to help maintain order, Angel gathered the mutants who were not on Utopia to form a team of X-Men, and called in Storm, Angel, Northstar, Dazzler and Pixie. Unknown to the team, the Collective Man had arrived in San Francisco and had forcefully taken over an underground Chinese criminal organization. It was also revealed that the Sublime Corporation has also developed a gene altering chemical that provided 5 unknown individuals with the powers of the first class of X-men.<\/p><h3>World War Wendigo<\/h3><p>Wolverine, sneaking away to Canada on his own, goes to answer a distress call from his old friend Heather Hudson. She is concerned about her husband, believing that something terrible has happened to him. Wolverine agrees to help her find him, and the Amazing X-Men (Rachel Grey, Iceman, Storm, Firestar, Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Northstar) travel to Canada to find the now vulnerable Wolverine. After tracking him down, they come across several Wendigo. The Wendigo Curse is transforming the Canadian citizens into mindless, savage Wendigo. Alpha Flight member Talisman prepares to mystically solve the problem, when Wolverine is transformed into a Wendigo, and nearly kills Talisman. The X-Men are joined by the rest of Alpha Flight. Northstar and Aurora reunite and battle and work with Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor to get the Wendigo across the border into the United States. The curse was only functional in Canada.<\/p><h2>Powers<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/76958-185994-northstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76958\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4925\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/76958-185994-northstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76958\"><img alt=\"Superspeed\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\" data-width=\"428\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/76958-185994-northstar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/76958-185994-northstar.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Superspeed\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/76958-185994-northstar.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/76958-185994-northstar.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\" data-width=\"428\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Superspeed<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Northstar, like his sister Aurora, has complete control over the kinetic energy of the atomic motion in his bodies molecules, which he can channel in a single direction. He normally uses that power to travel and fly at superhuman speeds. When concentrating, Northstar can accelerate his body to a velocity in direct proportion to the amount of kinetic energy he has tapped. It is theoretically possible for him to come close to moving at light speed, however, he would be unable to breathe and his body would suffer injuries due to the immense wind and friction. Northstar's skin is able to withstand speeds of up to at least mach 10 without injury as his body is made more durable due to the atomic motion he creates. Northstar also has greatly enhanced agility and reflexes, being able to dodge items and make sharp turns while moving at speeds of up to Mach 18.7. Northstar is able to perform a variety of feats such as; create concussive blasts with his light based abilities, use his atomic motion control to compensate for any disturbances in the G-Force, complete complicated tasks (such as reading) at high speeds, run across water, create cyclones by running in circles, and move only one part of his body at superhuman speeds. An example of this would be when Northstar repeatedly strikes an opponent in only fractions of a second. This technique has been shown to hurt even the <a href=\"\/hulk\/4005-2267\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\"> Hulk<\/a>.<\/p><p>It has been noted that Northstar is slightly faster than his sister Aurora, however she has more endurance and is able to travel longer than he can in the same amount of time. By coming into physical contact with his sister, Northstar can change the rate at which his molecules accelerate in order to let out an extremely bright burst of light. This power has been altered through out his time with Alpha Flight thanks to genetic experiments on Aurora, however it has currently been reverted back to its original state, with the twins having more control over the light which they generate.<\/p><p>After their alteration by the Children of the Vault, it appears that both Northstar and Aurora have enhanced abilities. Both have demonstrated super-strength, as well as the ability to cause an explosion when in contact, but the extent of these new abilities is still unknown, if they are even present at all.<\/p><p>Northstar is also noted for being an accomplished trapeze artist, novelist, and world-class skier.<\/p><h2>Characteristics<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/107485-58304-northstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-107485\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4475\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/107485-58304-northstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-107485\"><img alt=\"Jean-Paul Beaubier\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/107485-58304-northstar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/107485-58304-northstar.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jean-Paul Beaubier\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/107485-58304-northstar.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1494\/107485-58304-northstar.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Jean-Paul Beaubier<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><b>Hair:<\/b> Black<\/li><li><b>Eyes:<\/b> Blue<\/li><li><b>Height:<\/b> 5'11\"<\/li><li><b>Weight:<\/b> 185 lbs (84 kg)<\/li><li><b>Gender<\/b>: Male<\/li><li><b>Unusual Features<\/b>: Silver streaks in his hair and slightly pointed ears<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Known Relatives<\/b>: <a href=\"\/aurora\/4005-3189\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3189\"> Jeanne-Marie aka Aurora<\/a>, twin sister, Jean-Baptiste Beaubier (alternately given as Jean-Claude Baptiste; father, deceased), unnamed mother (deceased), Louis Martin (adoptive father, deceased), Genevieve Martin (adoptive mother, deceased), Joanne Beaubier (adopted daughter, deceased)<\/li><li><b>Citizenship<\/b><b>:<\/b> Canadian<\/li><li><b>Marital Status:<\/b> Married to Kyle Jinadu<\/li><li><b>Occupation:<\/b> Former terrorist, adventurer, teacher, businessman, novelist, professional skier, trapeze artist, thief<\/li><li><b>Education:<\/b> High school level<\/li><li><b>Place of Birth<\/b>: Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada<\/li><\/ul><h2>Alternate Realities<\/h2><h3>Earth-1610<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/243944-166730-northstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243944\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1333333333333\" data-width=\"330\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 330px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/243944-166730-northstar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243944\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Northstar\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" data-width=\"564\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/243944-166730-northstar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/243944-166730-northstar.jpg 330w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Northstar\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/243944-166730-northstar.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6754\/243944-166730-northstar.jpg 330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" data-width=\"564\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ultimate Northstar<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Northstar initially shows up in Ultimate X-Men when he is recruited by <a href=\"\/nightcrawler\/4005-1461\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\"> Nightcrawler<\/a> and <a href=\"\/angel\/4005-2112\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\"> Angel<\/a>. With Jean-Paul clearly upset, the two X-Men attempt to stop him from committing suicide by jumping off of a roof, although this was not his intention. He later admits that he was kicked off the track team for supposed steroid use and then figures out that he is a mutant after Angel and Nightcrawler continue to talk with him. He vehemently refuses their offer to join the X-Men, claiming that his father, the Canadian Ambassador, had already warned him about their supposed school. Jean-Paul quickly speeds off and begins to roam around the city before being approached by <a href=\"\/mr-sinister\/4005-3179\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\"> Mr. Sinister<\/a> who attempted to murder the young mutant. Northstar barely survived, thanks to his quick reflexes, which allowed the bullet to miss his vital organs. Northstar was later awakened in the hospital by the telepathic <a href=\"\/jean-grey\/4005-3552\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\"> Jean Grey<\/a>, who read his mind in order to discover the identity of his shooter. After being told that <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\"> Colossus<\/a> watched over him the entire night, Northstar asked if he was single, although Jean and Colossus both immediately leave to help the X-Men find Mr. Sinister.<\/p><p>Jean-Paul is later recruited by <a href=\"\/emma-frost\/4005-1457\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\"> Emma Frost<\/a> in order to join her school of both gifted humans and mutants known as the Academy of Tomorrow. Northstar most likely joins because the school is more pacifistic in nature and includes both humans and mutants, as Northstar previously said he did not believe in segregation. During his time at the Academy, Northstar completed the Advanced Workshop Program which allowed him to participate in off-campus community service missions in conjunction with the local authorities. During one of these missions, <a href=\"\/polaris\/4005-1473\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\"> Lorna Dane<\/a> was framed for the murder of many innocent by standers after her powers seemingly go out of control. She was subsequently placed in the Triskelon building where she was placed in the same prison as <a href=\"\/magneto\/4005-1441\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\"> Magneto<\/a> due to their similar power sets. A group of students, which included Northstar, attempt to break Lorna out of her prison, placing them in direct conflict with both the <a href=\"\/ultimates\/4060-40504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\"> Ultimates<\/a> and the X-Men. During their battle, it became apparent that Northstar had grown in power as he was able to take out some key members of both teams, including fellow speedster <a href=\"\/quicksilver\/4005-1467\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\"> Quicksilver<\/a>. At one point, Northstar again expressed a romantic interest in Colossus before he was taken out by <a href=\"\/havok\/4005-3546\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\"> Alex Summers<\/a>. Northstar then carried Alex across the water and up the side of the Triskelon building where they witnessed Magneto breaking out of his prison. Lorna is soon cleared of the charges and Northstar returned to the Academy of Tomorrow.<\/p><p>It was later shown that both Northstar and <a href=\"\/colossus\/4005-1460\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\"> Colossus<\/a> had kept in contact since their last encounter and Northstar invited Colossus to his school's homecoming dance (which he accepted). Unfortunately the dance is interrupted by the Brotherhood, and after the apparent death of Charles Xavier, Colossus agreed to live with Northstar at his school where the two continued their romantic relationship. A softball game between the two schools was later interrupted by Northstar's sister, Aurora and the Alpha Flight team. A battle ensued between Alpha Flight and the X-Men, although all of Alpha Flights members seemed to be addicted to the drug known as Banshee, or the <a href=\"\/mutant-growth-hormone\/4015-42280\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42280\"> Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH)<\/a> allowing them to easily defeat their opponents. Alpha Flight is successful in retrieving Northstar, taking him back to their base and forcing him to take MGH.

Even though Dust can control her dust cloud, it can be controlled by others who have abilities such as Telekinesis or Aerokinesis. Dust's dust form is resistant to magic, according to Belasco.

Throughout that time, the identity of the Black Racer has changed. His most recent incarnation was that of army veteran Willie Walker. Currently, Black Racer has no mortal incarnation.<\/p><p>Willie Walker was a war veteran, who during the <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/vietnam-war\/4015-56024\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56024\">Vietnam War<\/a>, was injured and paralyzed. Once back in America, he was a witness to a murder done by a crook named \"Sugar Man.\" Sugar Man was going to kill Willie, even though he couldn't say anything, but Willie's despair summoned the Black Racer, who could hear his thoughts, who saved Willie and passed his power on to him. The power of the Black Racer freed Willie from paralysis, but only when he became Black Racer. Now Willie is the Black Racer, and when it was time for him to hunt his quarry (and he knew when it was the time and who his quarry is) he could become the Black Racer, relentless and unshakable in his purpose!<\/p><h3><b>Death of the New Gods<\/b><\/h3><p><a href=\"\/infinity-man\/4005-27485\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27485\">Infinity-Man<\/a> killed Black Racer in the first issue of eight-part <a href=\"\/death-of-the-new-gods\/4045-48489\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48489\">Death of the New Gods<\/a> <a href=\"\/mini-series\/4015-56281\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56281\">mini-series<\/a>, tearing out his heart so that he would not interfere with the Source's plans. <a href=\"\/serifan\/4005-21182\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21182\">Serifan<\/a>, one of the <a href=\"\/forever-people\/4060-25939\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25939\">Forever People<\/a>, was seen leaving the room after Willie's death.<\/p><h3>Final Crisis<\/h3><p>Black Racer, however, can never truly be destroyed, and is next seen in his fifth world incarnation chasing after <a href=\"\/barry-allen\/4005-22804\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen<\/a>, who came back from the dead to fight against <a href=\"\/darkseid\/4005-2349\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid<\/a>.

The Flashes use this to lead the Racer to Darkseid, whom the Racer then collects, ending his reign over Earth.<\/p><p>It is also revealed that Black Racer is the same being as <a href=\"\/black-flash\/4005-43141\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43141\">Black Flash<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Powers<\/h3><p>The Black Racer's most iconic power is his touch. With a touch he can end the life of even gods. As the bringer of death, great starts are left as husks by his passing. In addition to that tremendous power, The Black Racer also has powers to aid the hunting of his quarry. His speed such that he could effortlessly keep up with <a href=\"\/lightray\/4005-5317\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5317\">Lightray<\/a> going top speed, toying with him. His agility is great enough that he could easily leap over a fiery, light-speed holocaust hurled at him by Lightray. The Black Racer is able to pass through stars unfazed. He senses when a god is near death, and is able to track them, appearing instantly at their side if necessary. His healing powers cured Willie Walker of his paralysis, and his telepathy enabled him to hear Willie's thoughts of despair. He's able to fly either in an atmosphere or space. He chases quarry without effort, never tiring, never stopping, an unshakable, relentless force.<\/p><h3>Weaknesses<\/h3><p>Despite all the power of the Black Racer, he must still bow to the will of destiny, which can change his course taking him where he is needed.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":"{'api_detail_url': 'https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-11473\/', 'id': 11473, 'name': 'Death is the Black Racer!', 'issue_number': '3'}","gender":"Male","image":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/4829007-screen%20shot%202015-09-30%20at%207.20.33%20am.png","name":"Black Racer","publisher":"DC Comics","real_name":"Willie Walker","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/black-racer\/4005-10032\/","year":1971.0,"first_appearance_date":"1971-Jul","decades":"The 70s","background":"During the 1970s in the United States, cultural trends included the popularization of Blaxploitation films and Kung-Fu epics.

When John was fifteen, he went joyriding as he often did in his aunt's car along with his younger brother Damon and younger sister Rose. A drunk driver crashed into them, causing a terrible accident that killed Rose. The event was so traumatic for John that he blocked some of those memories and turned his attitude around to be more focused and disciplined.<\/p><p>Graduating from school, John wanted to become an architect, but he joined the <a href=\"\/us-marine-corps\/4060-44416\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44416\">U.S. Marine Corps<\/a> first. The experience further honed his focus and discipline, and he excelled as a sniper. He succeeded in becoming an architect after leaving the corps. However, the job he landed a firm only lasted eight months before he was fired.

The series ran for 18 issues and featured John acting as caretaker of a community of various alien cities forcibly brought together by a mad Guardian. It also featured John's evolution into the first human Guardian. The series was clearly focused on elevating the status of John's character, building him up to show he was different from Hal Jordan in ways other than just race and in some ways more formidable than Hal. The series was both a commercial and critical success.<\/p><p>However, DC editorial decided it was to be cancelled by the time the fifth issue came out, claiming it simply did not fit with their editorial vision and giving writer <a href=\"\/gerard-jones\/4040-41475\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41475\">Gerard Jones<\/a> a year to finish the story.

After reaching this height of a starring role, the character of John Stewart fell into a slow decline of status.

In his extreme loneliness, Appa linked minds with John and unknowingly became influence by John's unconscious mind, which suffered greatly from guilt over Xanshi's destruction and the death of Katma Tui. This prompted Appa to devise a mad plan to create a new world on Oa by stealing cities from other planets. He called it his Mosaic. The return of the Guardians of the Universe stopped him from taking his plan any further, and Appa Ali Apsa died. What he had built of the Mosaic remained on Oa, and John Stewart was assigned as its caretaker.<\/p><p>The stress of trying to form a community out of the Mosiac took its toll on John's mind, which was already still reeling from his mind link with Appa Ali Apsa. To others, it appeared that John was becoming unhinged. He developed a messiah complex, feeling intensely that it was up to him to make the dream of Mosaic work. The Guardians refused to intervene, and when Hal Jordan tried, John defeated him. John saw Mosaic as his penance for Xanshi. He was absolutely committed to making Mosaic work, and he began to succeed in spite of his peers lack of faith in him. He evolved as the Guardians expected him to, becoming a Guardian himself.<\/p><h3>Emerald Twilight<\/h3><p>Just when Mosaic was finally coming together, it all fell apart when Hal Jordan destroyed the Green Lantern Corps at the nudging of <a href=\"\/parallax\/4005-41293\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\">Parallax<\/a>.

There was an energy blockage left over from what Hal did that was preventing John from walking again, so he removed it. However, John found he could still not walk. It was then John's psychologist who helped him realize why. For a long time, he had been repressing the memories of the car accident during his childhood that killed his sister and subconsciously punishing himself. Once John realized this and accepted the truth, he was able to walk again because he was no longer punishing himself for the loss of his sister.<\/p><p>After <a href=\"\/terry-berg\/4005-6956\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6956\">Terry Berg<\/a> was brutally beaten for being homosexual, Kyle lost the will to stay on Earth. He needed to get away from Earth for awhile, and he left John a letter explaining this. With the letter was left a power ring. Kyle had trusted John to protect things while he was gone, and John was glad to aid the opportunity. It had been years since he took to the skies as a Green Lantern, and he was finally able to do it again. John would later join the <a href=\"\/justice-league-of-america\/4060-31815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League of America<\/a>.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Agent Orange<\/h3><p>As part of the fully fledged Green Lantern again, John was among the Lanterns to escort the Guardians to the <a href=\"\/vega-system\/4020-55817\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55817\">Vega System<\/a> in order to confront <a href=\"\/larfleeze\/4005-58504\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58504\">Larfleeze<\/a>, the owner of the <a href=\"\/orange-lantern-corps\/4060-50745\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50745\">Orange Lantern Corps<\/a>.

The violet light washed away her desire for revenge on him, and she now told him that she forgave him for Xanshi's destruction.

The <a href=\"\/sinestro-corps\/4060-42352\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\">Sinestro Corps<\/a> rushes in and kills many Green Lanterns. While the battleground was held, Oa was badly wounded during the attack and the Green Lantern's numbers were reduced greatly. During this time, John Stewart relived the memories of failing to save Xanshi. He was saved by Hal Jordan and the group found out about an attack on Earth from the Sinestro Corps. With Earth's Green Lanterns and heroes protecting <a href=\"\/coast-city\/4020-47879\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47879\">Coast City<\/a> and the world from the Sinestro Corps, more secrets were revealed about the future of the corps.

He is the one to first attack the alien creature Konvikt, but when he's on the verge of defeating him, his concentration suddenly snaps, and starts muttering incoherently in binary code. A moment later, he spontaneously generates complex weapons from his body, by means unrelated to his ring. Later, he attempts to overexert himself to know how he generated those weapons by running a brutal training session against holographic Qwardian Thunderers, which does not work. He later shows Firestorm the machinery used to monitor the Cosmic Egg imprisoning <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Krona_(comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Krona<\/a>, but as he leaves again, he suffers from a relapse and start generating knives from his uniform, and it is revealed the entire system is broken.<\/p><p>Later, on board the Antimatter Earth Crime Syndicate satellite, he again loses control and nearly brings down the satellite with his blasts. It is revealed these discharges are brought about due to John's absorption of a Qwardian super-weapon, the Void Hound, which has been trying to escape its containment, or at least seize control of Stewart. After the sweeping, devastating effects of the spell engineered by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Morgaine_le_Fey_(DC_Comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morgaine le Fey<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enigma_(DC_Comics)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enigma<\/a>, he is seen in an Earth under the control of a totalitarian Justice Society, where all Green Lanterns are forbidden to be. He eventually starts breaking down, and with the Void Hound gaining enough hold on him to force him to create a black hole which forces him back to Earth, he has no choice but to comply. The Void Hound is later revealed to be a servant of Krona, and it's hold over John is broken when Krona is defeated.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Worlds Collide<\/h3><p>After a massive battle between the JLA and the Shadow Cabinet, John chooses to stay with the League despite many of its members choosing to leave. After Kimiyo Hoshi goes missing while tracking down Shadow Thief, John blackmails the armored vigilante Hardware into helping the team track her down. The League arrives in the Himalayas, discovering Kimiyo and Superman's friend Icon engaged in a fierce battle with the cosmic vampire known as Starbreaker. The JLA defeats Starbreaker, and John takes a leave of absence to go to Xanshi.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h3>Blackest Night<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078382\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3027989821883\" data-width=\"1965\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1965px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078382\"><img alt=\"Black Lantern Corps on his tail\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" data-width=\"491\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 1965w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 736w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 491w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Lantern Corps on his tail\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 1965w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 736w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1078382-john_stewart.jpg 491w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" data-width=\"491\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Black Lantern Corps on his tail<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During the events of <a href=\"\/blackest-night\/4045-55766\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night,<\/a> John joined Hal, Kyle, and Guy on the anniversary of Superman's death and also the anniversary of Coast City being deemed \"<i>the city without fear<\/i>.\" After the ceremony, John left to go honor the people of Xanshi, the planet he failed to protect.

He defeated the Guardians and installed Parallax back into the Central Power Battery, which allowed Parallax to take control of the vast majority of the Green Lantern Corps through the newly restored yellow impurity. With the help of <a href=\"\/ganthet\/4005-6951\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6951\">Ganthet<\/a>, John and Kyle were able to resist long enough to remove their power rings. However, this left them helpless on Oa with an army of enslaved Green Lanterns. Ganthet covered their back, allowing them to take refuge in the tunnels underground Oa. Eventually, they were able to regroup with Guy and Hal, who had also abandoned their power rings after realizing the yellow impurity had returned stronger than ever before.<\/p><p>In order to have the power to fight, Hal proposed they use the power rings he collected from the leaders of the other Lantern Corps, who had already been taken out by Krona. Hal gave John the indigo power ring, and John became an <a href=\"\/indigo-tribe\/4060-50746\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50746\">Indigo Lantern<\/a>.<\/p><p>Hal wanted them to go directly after Parallax in the Central Power Battery, but John disagreed with that planet. Mogo was in orbit of Oa and under Krona's control.

Hal would not agree, so the four ended up splitting with Kyle going with John to save Mogo. John was slow to figure out how to use his power as an Indigo Lantern but began to get the hang of it as they descended into Mogo's core.<\/p><p>Kyle almost succeeded in freeing Mogo, but the leftover taint of the Black Lantern Corps prevented it. Sentient beings were dying and Krona's forces were growing with every second Mogo was under his control, so John made a difficult decision. He harnessed the power of a Black Lantern and killed Mogo. Kyle, horrified by Johns actions, attempts to gather pieces of Mogo together in order to restart his core but they fall apart. Later on John and Kyle meet back with Hal and Guy and Ganthet and attempt to use the full power of all the different Corps ring to crack open the Central Power battery and release Parallax. While their combined effort was unable to continue as they were under attack by other Corps members. Guy Gardner with the Red Ring of Rage and the Star Sapphire Ring of Compassion manages to break open the Central Battery and releases Parallax from the Central Power Battery. The other Lanterns are then broken from Krona's control and being preparations for their final showdown with the New Guardian Entities and Krona.<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><h3>Power Ring<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-884974\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.7853170189099\" data-width=\"899\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 899px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-884974\"><img alt=\" John Stewart wielding his infamous sniper rifle construct. \" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg 899w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" John Stewart wielding his infamous sniper rifle construct. \" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg 899w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11746\/884974-gl_corps_41.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption> John Stewart wielding his infamous sniper rifle construct. <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>John is a wielder of a Green Lantern Power Ring, which enables him to construct anything out of light based on his imagination and willpower.

This version of John is a young detective in the NYPD, rather than an architect. In the backstory of the series, it is revealed that John is Earth's newest Green Lantern, having been chosen as Kyle Rayner's replacement (unlike in the comics, where John was a member of the Corps long before Kyle). However, John's friend and mentor Hal Jordan was eventually corrupted by Parallax, which began a massive conflict that ended with the decimation of most of the Corps and the planet of Oa. John is now one of the few remaining Green Lanterns, alongside <a href=\"\/kilowog\/4005-6952\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6952\">Kilowog<\/a>, <a href=\"\/salaak\/4005-11304\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11304\">Salaak<\/a>, <a href=\"\/aya\/4005-83912\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83912\">Aya<\/a>, <a href=\"\/chp\/4005-41359\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41359\">Ch'p<\/a> and Katma Tui.<\/p><p>In the present, John first appears shortly after Clark Kent is given the deceased <a href=\"\/tomar-re\/4005-10449\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10449\">Tomar-Re<\/a>'s ring to police the colony of Argo. John is tasked with training the reluctant new recruit, leading to some initial friction between them. Clark also inadvertently begins to sowing doubts within John after questioning why they need to follow the orders of the Guardians without knowing why. For instance, John is shown to be somewhat embarrassed when he admits that he doesn't know what makes his ring work, despite having worn it for over a decade. When the <a href=\"\/the-manhunters\/4060-55857\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55857\">Manhunter androids<\/a> attack Metropolis, John and Clark team up to defeat them. After destroying the Manhunters on the moon, John discovers that the androids were powered by yellow rings. <\/p><p>It is explained that in the past, the Guardians created the yellow rings to empower a special group of shock troops who were tasked with defeating the rogue Manhunters. However, the use of the yellow rings is what eventually drew Parallax out of the darkness, allowing it to possess Hal. Salaak then reveals to John that the Guardians did not really die during the war, and that they willingly allowed themselves to be taken prisoner by Parallax in exchange for the creature no longer terrorizing the galaxy. When John and Clark track down Parallax, it explains that it feels the treaty with the Guardians has been broken, meaning that it may once again spread fear across the universe. Parallax sends a number of yellow rings down to Earth, seeking to create a new Lantern Corps to serve it. While Clark heads to Earth to deal with the rings, John battles Parallax in space.<\/p><p>The creature takes advantage of John's doubt, and offers to resurrect Hal, as well as the other deceased Lanterns like Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner, in exchange for John's servitude. This allows Parallax to corrupt John with a yellow ring, which overwhelms him. John attacks Clark on Earth and badly wounds him, but is freed from Parallax's influence after <a href=\"\/emil-hamilton\/4005-3770\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3770\">Emil Hamilton<\/a> is temporarily able to shut down the yellow ring. After Clark defeats Parallax, John and the other surviving Green Lanterns decide to rebuild the Corps, with themselves serving as the new Guardians. John also informs Clark that the new Corps will only accept willing volunteers, meaning that the Kryptonian no longer has to worry about policing Argo. With that, John says goodbye to Clark, and takes his ring to find a suitable replacement on Argo. <\/p><p>John later returns during the battle with the <a href=\"\/the-monitors\/4060-48220\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-48220\">Monitors<\/a>, and helps defend Earth.

Voiced by Phil LaMarr, John Stewart was chosen as the primary Green Lantern over Kyle Rayner and Hal Jordan in order to give the series a more diverse cast and because John's more strict and abrasive personality had more potential to create a dramatic group dynamic.<\/p><p>In the show's continuity, John's history had notable differences from the continuity of the comics. He had a career as a U.S. Marine rather than an architect. He had also served as a Green Lantern for over ten years, presumably making him the first human Green Lantern since there was never any acknowledgement of Hal Jordan or Guy Gardner preceding him. Katma Tui was his former lover rather than wife and did not die. Kyle Rayner existed as a recently recruited member of the Green Lantern Corps, spending most of the time in space being trained. Finally, rather than being responsible for the destruction of a planet, John was framed for the deed by <a href=\"\/kanjar-ro\/4005-6904\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6904\">Kanjar Ro<\/a> and the Manhunters.<\/p><p>John became a founding member of the Justice League after teaming with other heroes to repel an alien invasion. As the group dynamic developed, John became particularly close with the Flash, <a href=\"\/wally-west\/4005-23879\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West<\/a> in the series, and Hawkgirl, <a href=\"\/hawkwoman\/4005-5693\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5693\">Shayera Hol<\/a> in the series. His friendship with Wally took the form of an odd couple dynamic, pitting John's serious professionalism against Wally's comedic recklessness. His relationship with Shayera became romantic and was the biggest romance of the series. In the finale of Justice League, Shayera was exposed as a Thanagarian spy and John faced off against her former lover, <a href=\"\/hro-talak\/4005-57290\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57290\">Hro Talak<\/a>.<\/p><h4><strong><a href=\"\/justice-league-unlimited\/4075-57\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-57\">Justice League Unlimited<\/a><\/strong><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-796035\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-796035\"><img alt=\"John Stewart, as he appears in JLU\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"John Stewart, as he appears in JLU\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26503\/796035-1057.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>John Stewart, as he appears in JLU<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Justice League did not end but simply changed its name to <i>Justice League Unlimited<\/i>, shifting the focus of the show to a greatly expanded Justice League.

However, John remained with Vixen for the time being because he was not comfortable with the idea that his future had already been decided for him. The series ended with their relationship unresolved and John choosing to be with Vixen.<\/p><p>John Stewart's starring role in this series was arguably the most popular the character had ever been. It gave more spotlight and development to the character than he ever had in the comics and propelled him into the mainstream consciousness.

For sixteen hours, they went on a rampage, and told all present to beware the Justice League, and Earth.<\/p><p>John Stewart was one of the six leaguers on an away mission who was recalled to the Watchtower. This was Vandal Savage's response when the Team successfully disconnected Plastic Man, the Atom, Captain Atom, and Hawkman from Klarion's control. Upon his arrival, the Green Lantern incapacitated the vaccinated Red Tornado, allowing for the enthralled Superman and Wonder Woman to tear off the android's limbs and remove him from the fight. When the Team arrived, Stewart was taken out by Sphere.

After a series of experiments she was given the ability to produce large amounts of ice-and snow, survive in severe cold temperatures, and change her appearance into a blue skinned meta-human.
